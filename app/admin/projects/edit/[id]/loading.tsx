// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the loading component uses these variables within its logic.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution by declaring these variables.
// A proper solution would involve examining the original code and either importing the variables
// or declaring them with appropriate initial values and types based on their usage.

const it = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const is = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const and = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
